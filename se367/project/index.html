<h3>Abstract:</h3>
<p>This work aims at developing an anticipatory gaze
model, in a top-down approach. In the past there have been many
models that can track relevant objects from a video making use of
computer vision. But one crucial difference is that, a human eye
can learn to anticipate the trajectory of an object very quickly in
an unsupervised fashion. A sportsperson knows the importance
of trajectory estimation better than anyone else. For example,
in cricket it is very crucial that the batsman estimates length,
bounce and type (swing, spin etc.) of the delivery in a fraction
of seconds. In a study by Land & McLeod, 2000 three skilled
batsmen facing medium paced deliveries looked at the ball for
the first 100-150ms of flight and then made a rapid glance (or
saccade) at approximately 50-80% of the ball flight duration
to the predicted ball bounce location. This kind of anticipation
comes with prolonged training. We aim to build a computational
model that could imitate the way humans learn to anticipate the
trajectory of fast moving objects.</p>

<p>We start of building a dataset for the training phase. The dataset consists of a ball bouncing off the walls and
floor as viewed from different viewpoints. The ball's speed
and release direction are randomly chosen with a swing/spin
components incorporated in few of the videos. Then, for each video, the ball is segmented out and all relevant data is collected.
The objective to learn the Transision matrix can then be framed as a Linear Regression problem. Now for a given test video, conditioned on the data collected till then, a Kalman Filter predicts the future location of the ball well in advance.</p>
