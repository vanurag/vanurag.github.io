<h3>Analysis of English Reading:</h3>
<ol>
<li> The only significant backtracking of my gaze occured twice. First one happened at "supported would be wrong" in the second paragraph. I backtracked to the name of Darwin's work "On the origin of Species". The second happened at the end of the video to the words "Lamarck" and once again to the Darwin's work. I guess these were due to my tendency to summarize the keywords.
<li> I fixated longer at the start of the video and on the words "Lamarck", "organism" in the first paragraph. This might be due to their relevance to the context. In the second paragraph I fixated longer on "well aware", "knew" and "that". Fixation at "well aware" and "knew" could be due to the reason that these words are making an important claim. The fixation at "that" just might be due to my tendency to pause once in a while, which I do quite often during reading.

<h3>Analysis of Hindi Reading:</h3>
<ol>
<li> I backtracked once at the end of first sentence to the word "Aakyan" maybe cause I haven't heard that word before. I backtracked the second time at the name "Harivansh Rai Bachchan" to the work of Munshi Prem Chand, "Nairashya Leela". Maybe this being a keyword and that it was enclosed in the quotes, I wanted to take a relook.
<li> I fixated longer at the words "Aaakyan", "Dharohar", "Kaaranavash" maybe because I have rarely heard them before. I have never seen " 'Ve' granthalay" occuring together, so I fixated long at that point. I took considerable time at the names "Rabindranath Tagore" and "Harivansh Rai Bachchan", the longest at the later maybe because I was trying to recognise his name, having heard it previously.
<li> My mean fixation time is far higher than while reading English because it's been long time since I have read "Shuddh" Hindi.
</ol>

<p><strong>P.S:</strong> My gaze data somehow is shifted vertically at the top. Maybe this is due to some calibration error. I have based my observations on the corrected version.</p>
