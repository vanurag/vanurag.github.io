<h1>Learning Human Actions</h1>

<p>
We intend to build an agent which could identify and classify various human actions that occur in a video (Eg: movies, TV series, news etc.). This would include these 3 important tasks:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>1.	Collecting clips belonging to each activity of interest to train the agent. Here is a <a href="http://www.irisa.fr/vista/actions/">dataset</a> of such actions collected automatically using movie scripts.</li>
<li>2.	Video representation using Space-Time Interest Points (STIP).</li>
<li>3.	Classification of actions using Non-linear support vector machine with multi channel kernel.</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
We also intend to implement joint learning <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5459194&tag=1">[2]</a> which combines knowledge from different activities to get to a conclusion. For instance, if the agent has been trained to detect &ldquo;getting out of a car&rdquo; and &ldquo;walk by a building&rdquo;, it should be able to detect &ldquo;getting out of a building&ldquo;. This would be benificial in surveillance for security reasons etc. If joint learning is implemented, the agent would require very minimal training.
</p>

<strong><i>Disclaimer</i></strong> - The approach to the problem and whether or not to implement joint learning is subject to change depending on the difficulty of the task and availability of time.
