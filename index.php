<p>
Hi! I am Anurag Sai. I am currently pursuing a B.Tech-M.Tech Integrated degree in Electrical Engineering from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kanpur. My research interests include Robotics, Vision and control. I am doing my thesis work under the joint supervision of <a href="http://home.iitk.ac.in/~lbehera" target="_blank" STYLE="text-decoration: none">Dr. Laxmidhar Behera</a> from Electrical Engineering Department and <a href="http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/amit/" target="_blank" STYLE="text-decoration: none">Dr. Amitabha Mukerjee</a> from Computer Science Department. My thesis is entitled "Autonomous Vision Based surveillance quadrotor". My work would be addressing mechanical design, control strategy and vision based navigation of a quadrotor. People further interested in knowing about my research/project work can go to  my <a href="projects.php" target="_blank" STYLE="text-decoration: none">Research</a> page.

<p>Apart from Math and science, I am interested in art, dance and food (who doesn't :P). Take a look at my Gallery!</p>

I am from Suryapet, a small town in Andhra Pradesh, India. I have done my basic education there. I did my 11th and 12th in Hyderabad where I started to get more passionate about Mathematics and Science. I always feel that the best way to learn anything is to try it out for yourself. That is when you fall in all possible pit-holes and even know how to get out of them by yourself. But ofcourse, little guidance would never hurt!
